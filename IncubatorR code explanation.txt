we have semi-structured train data and test data.(94 fields)
Preprocess: train and test data need to be regex classified.
            for example: 235URI_ufg90 will into 1A_a1.
            and so on so for other fields that need to be processed and classified.
            and we treat missing data in text col as "unknown" category, missing data in integer col as "-1" categor to differentiate.
            and then we sum up all levels (categories) in both train and test data to get full levels mapping.
Modelling: svm (support vector machine) and svm with tuning is performed on train data, since svm is cutting planes into 2.In this case, it is reponse variable 0/1, good candidate of svm model.
           we can also implement logistic with bagging, random forest, decision tree models, these are 0/1 models as well. since we don't have much time, svm is only performed.
           svm choose a tuning range, then code will find the best model upon comparing all results in the tuning range.
Testing: test data on test data set and find accuray rate.
